# Q: WAP that switches the vlues of two variables. The values stored in a and b should be swapped.

# don't change the code below ⬇️
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

# your code goes here: ➷

# First way
a,b = b,a
# Second way
c = a
a = b
b = c

# don't change the code below ⬇️
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

# Hint_1: you shuld not have to type any numbers in the code.
# Hint_2: you may need to use more variable to store the value of a or b.

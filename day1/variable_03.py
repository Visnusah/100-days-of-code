# Variables can be used to store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

#Here is name_one and name_two variables that stores a string and an integer:

# Simple code for understanding the concept of variables
name_one = "Visnu"
print(name_one) # Visnu
name_two = 1243
print(name_two) # 1243

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name) 
print(len(name))

# Example of logical operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements

# Example 1: and operator
a = 5
b = 3

if a > 0 and b > 0:
    print("Both a and b are positive")

# Example 2: or operator
a = 5
b = -3
if a > 0 or b > 0:
    print("At least one of a and b is positive")

# Example 3: not operator
a = 5
if not a > 0:
    print("a is not positive")
